   "meta_harden" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6slx45t, package fgg484, speed -3

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.23 2013-10-13".

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of       1    0%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       1    0%

      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  54,576    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
