    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          1 out of  27,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                        0 out of  27,288    0%
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     1 out of   6,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  13,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of       1    0%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       1    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           1 out of       1  100%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
